                Should the 8-Ball be a 2D interactive image or interactive 3D model?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Last meeting we weighed the pros and cons of having the 8 ball be a 2D image or a 3D model.
                We said that a 3D image would be more engaging for the user and could more closely replicate the experience of shaking 
                a magic 8-Ball, but that it would take more time to implement. 

                A 2D image that the user can click and generate a response from would be less complicated to implement, but also would 
                be less visually impressive to the user. 

                We decided to go with the 3D model over the course of the meeting.

                <li><h4>What generative API should we use for phrases?</h4></li>
                <p>
                    OpenAI has an API for developers that can allow us to 
                    generate responses to user questions. We can also specify length
                    of the responses, so that we can fit them in the display triangle.
